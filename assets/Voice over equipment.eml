Hello Dad,

Hope you're having a productive Monday. Royalle is going to send me five
different color variations based on the website's pallet and once I've
chosen one she'll design two avatar images for me. I'll keep you updated.
I've also started putting scripts together for some voice over demos. It
might take me a little while but I will send you files as I work through
them. Is it possible to keep adding demos after the site is already live?
I've included the list of my studio room equipment and software below, let
me know if you need any more information.

Computer: Lenovo Yoga i7 900 series
Recording and editing software: Audacity
Microphone and Preamp: Focus Rite Scarlett Solo 2i2  with Pop Filter
Recording Space: Voice-Over Essentials Porta-Booth Plus Vocal booth,
surrounding room is also treated with acoustic blankets.
